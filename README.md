# Flash Cards Learning Game 
Flash Cards is a learning game designed to help toddlers improve speech through interaction with technology and positive reinforcement. 
I created this game as a way to introduce my two year old son to technology and provide him with speech therapy. 

## Why Flash Cards Game  
• **Interactive learning.**  
• **Kids are attracted to screens, colors, buttons, sounds and animations.**  
• **Early exposure to technology and it's capabilities.**  
• **The computer provides positive reinforcement**  

## Implementation
• **WPF front end with animations, colorful-kid friendly colors and user interface.**  
• **Use of Windows 10 built-in voice recognition engine to convert voice to text and perform the functionality.**  
• **Implementation of T-SQL database to track speech improvements over time.**  

## How It Works
• **Select a player or create a new player connects directly to the SQL Database.**
